# Hardhat10K: A Large-scale Dataset for Deep Learning-based Hardhat-wearing Detection
This work introduced the Hardhat10K dataset with over 10,000 images for hardhat-wearing detection. Images containing long-distance, occluded, dense, and low-light objects were collected to enhance the model's robustness. Furthermore, images from various weather conditions and periods were added to improve the model's generalization ability. Finally, 300 background images were supplemented to enhance the model's accuracy.
The dataset was annotated with YOLO format and categorized into six classes: "hardhat", "head_with_hardhat", "person_with_hardhat", "head", "person_no_hardhat", and "face".
